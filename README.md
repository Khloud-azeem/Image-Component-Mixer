**Introduction** 

Fourier transform is a fundamental tool in the signal processing field.

**Descriptin**

A piece of software that explains the relative importance of the magnitude and phase components. The code is implemented on a 2D signal (i.e. image), but the same concept applies to any signal.  

The software should have the following features:
- Ability to open and show two images. For each image and several components based on a combo-box/drop-menu selection of 1) FT Magnitude, 2) FT Phase, 3) FT Real component, 4) FT Imaginary component.
- Mixing of two components based on a panel.
